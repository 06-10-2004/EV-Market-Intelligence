# EV-Market-Intelligence
Electric Vehicle Insights Project: SQL-powered data analysis and Power BI dashboard revealing trends in EV range, pricing, and eligibility.

# üöó Electric Vehicle Product Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

This project explores electric vehicle (EV) product-level data using SQL for deep data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization. The goal is to uncover key insights about EV pricing, range, battery capacity, speed, and eligibility for government incentives.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Analyze electric vehicle specifications and pricing trends.
- Identify top-performing EVs based on range, battery, and affordability.
- Compare vehicles by type (SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.).
- Explore the relationship between EV attributes and eligibility for government incentives.
- Visualize insights using interactive dashboards in Power BI.
